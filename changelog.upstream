    Fix dependency on CONFIG_SECCOMP
    
    Starting from the commit 066f883f8cd0cf645dd667658329e29dc7b2df3b
    LKRG can't be compiled without CONFIG_SECCOMP. Let's fix it here.

    CI: Disable seccomp filter for docker build tests
    
    When target system updated to glibc-2.34 (as for ALT Linux) it starts
    to use new syscall `clone3', which is not enabled in Docker seccomp
    filter, causing run failures. GA issue [1].
    
    Disable Docker seccomp filtering since we are in throwable virtual
    environment anyway and don't need that protection.

    [JUMP_LABEL] Add support for variable length patching
    
    Since kernel 5.14, JUMP_LABEL algorithm on x86(-64) architecture
    got a support for variable length patching:

    Fix a possible race condition in seccomp() syscall
    
    If a main process creates a sandbox via seccomp() syscall and uses
    SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_TSYNC flag to enforce all threads in that process
    to sync the same rules, it is possible that non-main threads will be
    executing other syscalls while such rules are being actively changing
    by the kernel.
    Such scenario might confuse LKRG which would think that such threads
    try to escape seccomp sandbox and LKRG would try to appropriately react.
    This commit fixes the issue and addresses #106

    Add support for x86/static_call used by TRACEPOINTs since kernel 5.10+
    
    Since kernel 5.10 tracepoints don't use JUMP_LABEL engine for .text kernel
    modification.
    Linux kernel introduced 'static_call' as a replacement for global function
    pointers. It uses code patching to allow direct calls to be used instead of
    indirect calls. Related Linux kernel commits:
    
    https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/e6d6c071f22de29e4993784fc00cd2202b7ba149

    Currently, only x86(-64) architecture has implementation for static calls.
    This commit should address #69

    Fix SELinux validation on kernels < 4.17
    
    Latest SELinux changes:
    https://github.com/openwall/lkrg/commit/59bed0a813d3d7336eddd44da8911dbcf593c8a4
    
    introduced two SELinux problems on kernels < 4.17. First, LKRG won't compile
    on such kernels due to function name mismatch. However, even if this would be
    fixed there is another issue in the same function. Instead of overwriting the
    value of SELinux state itself, the code was overwriting pointer. The second bug
    could never be triggered because of the first bug failing LKRG compilation for
    such kernels.
    This commit fixes both problems and addresses #60

    CI: Boot test on GA using mkosi
    
    Use mkosi to test full system boot with LKRG module loaded early in
    initrd. mkosi creates system disk image (quite slow, 5 minutes for
    ubuntu focal in my tests, and size is 1.3G), builds lkrg there (using
    systemd-nspawn), and finally boots it in qemu. Then we grep boot.log
    for possible problems.
    
    Ubuntu is chosen, because it's native to GA. Only successful (for the
    test) releases are 'focal' and 'groovy'. It seems mkosi does not support
    'hirsute' (yet, failure installing packages into image). Also, 'bionic'
    does not build lkrg properly, but mkosi works good. Older Ubuntu seems
    to not have systemd, which is a hard mkosi requirement.

    Add mkosi support
    
    mkosi is systemd's boot test tool. This support is mainly for GA CI
    to implement full boot tests (on Ubuntu). But, this would be useful
    on it's own for experiments with lkrg on all mkosi supported distros.
    
    I support only bios (grub) BootProtocol without unified kernel.
    
    - .gitignore updated to exclude mkosi artifacts (otherwise they could
      recursively go into created image causing disk full error).
    - mkosi.default is mkosi config pre-configured for ubuntu focal, you can
      overwrite this with command line options.
    - mkosi.build is script to build lkrg and install it into DESTDIR.
    - mkosi.postinst hook updates initrd to include and insmod lkrg and
      grub to remove 'quiet' cmdline option.

    README: Fixed punctuation, word choice, and word flow
    
    Made a few minor changes, particularly to punctuation, but also to word
    choice and word flow. For example, "might or might not" is more
    uncomfortable to say and read than "may or may not" as the ending "t"
    requires a stop. I believe these changes **may** (heh) increase readability
    marginally. I also did not go through and check the commands and their
    descriptions.

    SELinux: Disable state monitoring for kernels with randomized structs
    
    New Linux kernels may be built with the CONFIG_GCC_PLUGIN_RANDSTRUCT
    option.  This randomly changes the order of fields in certain structures,
    including selinux_state.  Currently, LKRG isn't capable to recreate the
    structure layout.  Thus, we have to disable LKRG's SELinux monitoring on
    kernels built with this option.
    
    CONFIG_GCC_PLUGIN_RANDSTRUCT was introduced to make it harder for attackers
    to overwrite particular fields of structures.  LKRG's goal was the same.
    So even disabling LKRG's monitoring, we still have some mitigations for
    SELinux state overwrites.
    
    We might make LKRG capable to recreate randomized structures in the future.

    Copy-builtin: optionally use git via LKRG_USE_GIT
    
    As pointed out by Solar Designer, git is somewhat non-germaine to
    the script as it's really part of an external workflow replicated
    across out-of-tree repos used by Semper Victus for the trees which
    we maintain in-house. The meat of the function in ths script puts
    data into the right places within a kernel tree, with the commit

    Add missing synchronization with kprobe optimizer
    
    If kernel is compiled with CONFIG_OPTPROBES we must synchronize with kprobe
    optimizer during the process of creating database. LKRG places many
    kretprobes which modifies .text section. In the standard scenario after
    placing the kprobes, LKRG can safely calculate the hash of all .text
    sections. However, if CONFIG_OPTPROBES is enabled, placed kprobes could be
    optimized. Optimization modifies .text seciton by converting kprobes into
    FTRACE which using different hooking mechanism. If LKRG is in the process
    of building the hash database and optimizer is running parallel, at least
    we could have FP and at most deadlock.
    This fix addresses described issue and reported bug #47

    Introduce a new compilation macro - P_KERNEL_AGGRESSIVE_INLINING
    
    Some custom compilation of the kernel might aggresively inline critical
    functions (from LKRG perspective). That's problematic for the project.
    However, some of the problems *might* be solved by uncommenting this new
    definition (P_KERNEL_AGGRESSIVE_INLINING). Unfortunately, not all of the
    problems can be solved by it (at least no for now). You need to experiment.
    This can be useful to address issues like #40

    Modify the logic how LKRG tracks the exec syscalls
    
    Since kernel 5.8 function search_binary_handler is not exported anymore.
    On the aggressively optimized kernels it is possible that
    `search_binary_handler` can be inlined. However, GCC can splits the
    function to put the big part in its own function, which receives as a name
    the original function name plus .part + .<some number>, and inlines the
    rest in other functions.
    
    This is a very problematic behavior from the LKRG point of view and was
    reported as #41 and #45. This commit fixes the problem by replacing the
    'search_binary_handler' (or 'do_execveat_common') hook with
    security_bprm_committing_creds and security_bprm_committed_creds.
    Additionally, this change is desired from the security point of view.

    Add synchronization with kprobe optimizer
    
    On the aggressively optimized kernels it is possible that kprobe optimizer
    won't be fast enough to do the job before LKRG creates own database. This
    is problematic because LKRG might snapshot hash of the kernel's .text
    section with non-optimized own hooks. As soon as the kprobe optimizer
    finishes the job, previously snapshoted hash won't be correct and LKRG will
    detect this inconsistency.
    To be able to correctly solve this unusual corner case problem, LKRG can
    wait for kprobe optimizer before creating database.

    Use module_init() and not late_initcall_sync() when building as module
    
    We switched to using late_initcall_sync() in order to have LKRG initialize
    sufficiently late when it's linked into the kernel.  That change was a
    no-op when building/loading LKRG as a module on recent kernels, because
    their module.h defines late_initcall_sync() as an alias for module_init().
    However, it broke LKRG on some older kernels, where late_initcall_sync()
    wasn't defined for modules at all.
    
    This commit fixes that by explicitly using module_init() when building LKRG
    as a module.  This change is a no-op on recent kernels.

    CONFIG_PAX_RANDKSTACK ^ P_VERIFY_ADDR_LIMIT
    
    There are unofficial versions of RANDKSTACK patches floating about
    the web, including in VMWare's PhotonOS.
    The randomized stack addresses conflict with LKRG's ADDR_LIMIT
    checks a la:
    ```
    [  195.272462] [p_lkrg] <Exploit Detection> Detected ADDR_LIMIT
    segment corruption! process[552 | sysctl] has different segment
    address! [7ffffffff000 vs ffffffffffffffff]
    ```
    
    Address this by ensuring that P_VERIFY_ADDR_LIMIT does not get
    defined when CONFIG_PAX_RANDKSTACK is enabled.
    
    This is a strange edge-case, and normally wouldn't be submitted as
    a pull request to upstream projects, except that users seeking to
    harden their kernels with public code are likely to run across
    LKRG and some links to the PhotonOS patches or similar extracts
    from Grsecurity's old patchsets. The commit is a no-op in 99% of
    cases, but may result in one less bug report over the next decade.

    Snapshot ADDR_LIMIT as task's attribute
    
    Many exploits use culnerability to corrupt 'addr_limit' and achieve full R/W primitive in the kernel. This is a 'known' technique. We can't verify 'addr_limit' as part of normal verification process because kernel might legitimately modify it via call set_fs(KERNEL..). However, there are places where we can enforce such policy, e.g. during generic_permission() or capable() hook as well as at the syscall hook. I'm adding such verification on execve() syscall as well. Since kernel 5.10 on x86 platform set_fs/get_fs API is removed (and addr_limit variable) but it's not the case for ARM architecture. Moreover, many Android exploit relies on 'addr_limit' corruption. This beta-version of 'addr_limit' verification can be effective and important feature.

    Add support for the delayed docker/container initialization
    
    Docker/containers require 'overlay' or 'overlay2' module for supporting storage/scratchspaces. To be able to correctly support docker environment LKRG needs to hook 'ovl_create_or_link' function from these modules. However, it is possible that during LKRG initialization, 'overlay[2]' is not loaded yet because of the delayed docker/containers initialization. In such case we will produce FP. This commit changes the requirement of loading 'overlay[2]' module before loading LKRG. Now, we are dynamically add necessary hooks.

    Build LKRG in-tree using copy-builtin.sh
    
    DKMS is not always desirable on a system which one intends to
    harden from local attackers. The build-chain creates a wide local
    attack surface and can be used to build kmode rootkits and other
    fun toys for red team. There are also space, performance,
    and security considerations such as leaving RANDSTRUCT seeds
    around in headers which can be addressed by bringing the module
    in with the kernel package.
    
    In order to avoid this, and take advantage of pending advances
    in LTO, KCFI, and other methods depending on or benefitting from
    having all of the code available at initial compile/link-time, a
    script has been added to update the desired kernel tree with the
    LKRG source code and relevant Makefile and Kconfig directives.
    
    Since LKRG is still in active development, this script pulls all
    relevant content and the current commit hash to let the kernel
    maintainers using it keep aware of how far they've fallen behind
    and see if subsequent commits merit a rebuild of the in-tree code.
    
    Testing:
     Build-tested against linux-hardened 5.4.84.a as module and linked
    directly into the kernel.
     Runtime testing with both build scenarios.

    Add task debugging infrastructure
    
    This is a relatively heavy feature. It introduces a possibility of having a 'ring-buffer' per each tracked task in the kernel. Such buffer keeps a history of important events (from LKRG perspective) related to this task

    Change locking logic
    
    KPROBE optimizer might replace KPROBE with FTRACE. If we are in the middle of initialization current logic might be incompatible. This patch fixes it.

    umh: Kill process using the proper SIGKILL signal.

    umh: Kill process using the proper SIGKILL signal.
    
    When we detect an invalid binary, we forbid it execution by changing the
    subprocess execution path with slashes.
    On some kernels, this may not work because we have to map the memory page as
    writable. At this moment of execution, we can stop executing the process using
    the froce_sig to send signals. The send_sig_info will not arrive at the right
    time.

    Simplify synchronization with JUMP_LABEL engine
    
    We don't need to introduce custom LKRG-counter lock to synchronize with JUMP_LABEL engine and avoid potential deadlock with FTRACE. We can check if jump_label lock is taken after acquiring ftrace lock and before taking text_mutex.
    This simplification changes p_text_section_(un)lock API.
    
    This also fixes problem reported by Jacek

    Add FTRACE support
    
    1) We are hooking into FTRACE's internal functions to be able to monitor when new modifications are executed and react accordingly.
    2) Linux kernel has bugs in FTRACE code. The LKRG may highlight them.
    3) We are introducing 'p_state_init' variable to track when full LKRG's initialization is complete.

    Add LKRG's counter lock around *JUMP_LABEL engine
    
    1) This is necessary for future FTRACE support. FTRACE is not fully synchronized with JUMP_LABEL (which I think is a buggy logic in the kernel). However, we can manually add such logic. The way how text_mutex is used by both subsystems makes it prone to deadlock if 3rd system wants to sync with both of them.
    2) New lock efnorces changes in p_text_section_(un)lock API which we do in the same commit
    3) Introduce new LKRG's counter lock API - trylock
    4) Add a few minor changes:
      - notrace attribute (probably, we need to add such attributes to majority of our functions)
      - add information about module name in case of KMOD notifier activity

    Remove internal JL sync lock
    
    It's OK to remove such lock, since LKRG .text section validation is syncing with the kernel through JL mutex and .text mutex. There is one corner case where these mutexes are not taken by the kernel when new kernel module might be compiled without long nops. In such case, Linux kernel might modify such .text and 'inject' long-nops where is needed, however, it is done when new module has UNFORMED state. UNFORMED modules can't be verified yet so we are fine.

    Don't include linux/cryptohash.h on recent kernels
    
    This fixes LKRG build on Linux 5.8+, which renamed that header file.  Thanks to
    Andy Lavr for reporting this problem and suggesting a (different) fix, which
    made us revisit our use of that header file.
    
    We only need that header file on older kernels (< 4.4.72 or < RHEL 7.4) for the
    one use of md5_transform() in get_random_long().  On newer kernels, we simply
    use the kernel-provided get_random_long().  Further, 5.8's crypto/sha.h doesn't
    declare md5_transform() anyway (linux/cryptohash.h on much older kernels did).

    It was reported that in a very slow devices, some of the busy loop of locking/unlocking text_mutext is too tight and optimize_kprobe() can't win the race of getting text_mutex. This simple patch helps to solve that problem.

    Add SMAP bit verification logic (x86 arch). It is guarded in the same way as SMEP. Two new LKRG sysctl interface are introduced to control verification and enforcement logic:
       1) Introduce 'smap_validate' to control if SMAP validation will be performed
           0 - disable SMAP validation
           1 - enable SMAP validation
       6) Introduce 'smap_enforce' to control how LKRG reacts when SMAP validation fails:
           0 - log & accept
           1 - log & restore
           2 - panic() - kill the kernel

    Refactor LKRG process tracking DB. Instead of relying on 1 global spinlock, now we have multiple RW-locks. This commit introduces 512 buckets of RB-trees + RW-locks. This commit significantly increases performance.

    Change the default log-level from P_LKRG_CRIT to P_LKRG_INFO when LKRG detects lost/extra module which is related to the current module activity events (system is stable and not hacked). Maybe we should use P_LKRG_WARN? for now it will be P_LKRG_INFO.

    This is a huge change. We completely rewrote communication channel and added a lot of new configuration options. Summary:
    
     1) Introduce 'kint_validate' to control kernel/system integrity logic:
        0 - disabled
        1 - validation is performed only when manually triggered
        3 - validation is performed periodically by timer interrupt and on random events
     2) Introduce 'kint_enforce' to control how LKRG reacts when kernel/system integrity fails:
        0 - log & accept corruption
        1 - log only (for SELinux and CR0.WP violation log & restore original values)
        2 - panic() - kill the kernel
    
     3) Introduce 'pint_validate' to control tasks validation logic:
        0 - disabled
        1 - validate only currently running tasks
        2 - validate only currently running tasks + task which changes state to RUNNING
        3 - validate all tasks in the system (paranoid mode)
     4) Introduce 'pint_enforce' to control how LKRG reacts when task validation fails:
        0 - log & accept corruption
        1 - kill corrupted task
        2 - panic() - kill the kernel
    
     5) Introduce 'smep_validate' to control if SMEP validation will be performed
        0 - disable SMEP validation
        1 - enable SMEP validation
     6) Introduce 'smep_enforce' to control how LKRG reacts when SMEP validation fails:
        0 - log & accept
        1 - log & restore
        2 - panic() - kill the kernel
    
     7) Introduce 'umh_validate' to control if UMH validation will be performed
        0 - disable UMH validation
        1 - allow only whitelited binaries to execute via UMH
        2 - completely block UMH
     8) Introduce 'smep_enforce' to control how LKRG reacts when UMH validation fails:
        0 - log only
        1 - prevent execution
        2 - panic() - kill the kernel
    
     9) Introduce 'pcfi_validate' to control if pCFI validation will be performed
        0 - disabled
        1 - no stackwalk (weak pCFI)
        2 - fully enabled
    10) Introduce 'pcfi_enforce' to control how LKRG reacts when pCFI validation fails:
        0 - log only
        1 - kill corrupted task
        2 - panic() - kill the kernel
    
    11) Rename 'timestamp' to 'interval'
    12) Rename 'force_run' to 'trigger'
    13) Rename 'clean_message' to 'heartbeat'
    14) Rename 'msr_enforce' to 'msr_validate'
    
    15) Option 'hide' stays the same
    16) Option 'log_level' stays the same
    17) Option 'block_modules' stays the same

    [1] Change the logic how ED verifies processes:
        a) By default, only verify currently executed process
        b) Introduce a paranoid mode of process verification.
           This mode verifies all tasks in the system
           (like LKRG's old logic). This mode is executed from the
           CI verification routine.
    [2] Add new hooks to verify process credentials:
        a) cover that cases where various capabilities are checked
        b) before any task changes the state to TASK_RUNNING
    [3] Create multiple RB-trees for tracking ED process. Until now
        we had only 1 root RB-tree. new logic change can improve
        performance when system is overloaded.
    [4] Introduce a new ED API which enforces process to crash itself
        when SIGKILL can't be delivered
    [5] Enforce CPU metadata verification (like SMEP) in more places
    [6] Fix some minor issues

    [CI] Some kernels are not compiled with CONFIG_USB=y. E.g. Debian's kernel is setting CONFIG_USB=m and usbcode can (or not) be loaded dynamically. In such a case LKRG has no guarantee that USB notifiers are available in the system. They might be after usbcore being loaded but it's not enough. This commit takes this into account and in case 'usbcore' is not natively compiled in the system, usb notifiers are not used

    Change the way how to support CONFIG_STATIC_USERMODEHELPER

commit 1be9ad649bcde6f2a166758ca3a0efd88a22e831
Author: Adam_pi3 <pi3@pi3.com.pl>
Date:   Thu May 23 18:46:25 2019 +0000

    Cleanups:
     [1] Mask exporting global CFLAGS since it might be incompatible when LKRG is part of the bigger build project
     [2] Add default path for UMH when CONFIG_STATIC_USERMODEHELPER is used
     [3] Mask the most noisy STRONG_DEBUG output - doesn't have as much value. It can be always unmasked if needed.
     [4] Add support for the kernels without enabled CONFIG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG
     [5] Add support for the kernels without enabled CONFIG_ACPI

    [CI] Fix potential NULL deref when attacker modifies long NOP injected by *_JUMP_LABEL to JMP instruction (emulating *_JUMP_LABEL functionality) to hook control flow. If modification happens to the core kernel .text from the 3rd party module, and falls perfectly into *_JUMP_LABEL scenario, NULL deref is possible. LKRG correctly detects not-legit modification but might fall into this bug.

commit 110cd7189faa7d8d2dbc56854f3b705d6b77efbd
Author: Adam_pi3 <pi3@pi3.com.pl>

    1) This is a pretty big change in LKRG which brings support for 4.17+ kernels. 4.17 introduced a new logic how syscall stubs are created and change the name convetions + added new one. If kernel is compiled with CONFIG_IA32_EMULATION (implies CONFIG_COMPAT) and/or CONFIG_X32_X86 (and many distros does that), each syscall might generate up to 4 different stubs as an entry-point. Even 4 stubs exists, not all of them are used :) This of course affects Exploit Detection feature which needs to be aware about execution of critical syscalls, regardless if the entry point was from X32, IA32 or standard stub. Moreover, in the previous kernels, X32 ended up in the standard compat syscall, but now we need to create a separate hooks for the newly generated stubs. Also, now we need to add more syscalls to cover IA32_EMULATION logic - it was not needed in the previous kernels. I think this patch covers all corner cases - I hope I didn't miss anything :)   2) SELinux variables are now accumulated in one structure, before they were just global variables. We are addressing this change in this patch too.   3) Change the INFO messages (log_level=4) in case of error during ED initialization (more useful for debugging).   4) Change a bit the logic for monitoring a setgroups() syscall. This change is compatible across all kernels and can avoid monitoring multiple syscall stubs mentioned at point 1)
