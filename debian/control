Description: Linux Kernel Runtime Guard (LKRG)
 Linux Kernel Runtime Integrity Checking and Exploit Detection.
 .
 LKRG provides security through diversity.
 Similar to running an uncommon operating system (kernel) would.
 .
 It renders whole classes of kernel exploits ineffective. Makes other
 exploits less reliable and more difficult to write (see features [1]
 and security [2]). LKRG was developed by a security professional with
 review from other high profile security professionals (see authorship [3]).
